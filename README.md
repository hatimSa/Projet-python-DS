**E-commerce Price and Promotion Analysis**
This project aims to analyze the prices and promotions of various products available on several e-commerce platforms. The main objective is to collect, clean, and visualize the data to identify the best deals and price trends.
The analysis is based on data retrieved via APIs and web scraping (for platforms that do not have APIs). The results allow you to compare product prices, identify promotions, and explore trends for informed decision-making.
